<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams">Group Anagrams</a></h2> <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange' alt='Difficulty: Medium' /><hr><p>Given an array of strings <code>strs</code>, group <strong>the anagrams</strong> together. You can return the answer in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>An <strong>Anagram</strong> is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
<strong>Output:</strong> [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
</pre><p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> strs = [""]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[""]]
</pre><p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> strs = ["a"]
<strong>Output:</strong> [["a"]]
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= strs.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= strs[i].length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>strs[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>

## Solution Explanation

The solution groups anagrams from a list of strings using a character count signature method. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Initialize Hash Table**: Use a hash table (`defaultdict`) to group words by their character signatures.
2. **Generate Signatures**:
   - For each word in the list, initialize a fixed-size array (`signature`) of length 26 to zero, corresponding to the counts of each alphabet letter.
   - Count the frequency of each character in the word and update the `signature` array.
   - Convert the `signature` array to a tuple (to use it as a hashable key in the dictionary) and append the word to the corresponding list in the hash table.
3. **Collect Results**: Return the values of the hash table, which contain lists of anagrams.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of the words. The factor of 26 in the complexity arises from processing each character of each word to compute its signature, but it's generally absorbed into the `m` term.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * m)` because the hash table stores a key for each unique signature and a list of words corresponding to each signature. Each key is an array of length 26, and the words themselves take space proportional to their total length across all anagrams.
