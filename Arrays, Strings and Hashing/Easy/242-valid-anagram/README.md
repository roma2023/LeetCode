## Analysis of Approaches

### Sorting Both Strings
**Description**: A straightforward approach would be to sort both strings and then compare them for equality.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` due to the sorting process, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` needed to store the sorted strings if strings are immutable.
- **Drawbacks**: While simple, sorting can be slower for large strings and is less efficient than using hash tables.

### Counting Frequency with Array
**Description**: Since the problem is constrained to lowercase letters, use a fixed-size array of 26 to count character frequencies.
- **Pros**: Faster and more space-efficient for problems limited to a single case alphabetic characters.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the strings.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since the size of the array is constant and does not scale with the size of the input.

## Solution Explanation

The solution verifies whether two strings `s` and `t` are anagrams by counting the frequency of characters in each string. The algorithm uses a hash table (Python dictionary) to keep track of the frequency differences between `s` and `t`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Length Check**: If the strings have different lengths, they're not anagrams.
2. **Frequency Count**: Traverse both strings simultaneously. Increment the count for each character in `s` and decrement the count for each character in `t`.
3. **Validation**: After processing both strings, check if all counts are zero. If any count is non-zero, the strings are not anagrams.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input strings. We iterate through both strings once and then validate the frequency table.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` because the hash table stores the frequency of up to `n` distinct characters.

## Demonstration of the Optimal Solution

### Example Using Input 1

**Input**: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

1. **Initialize Hash Table**: Create a dictionary to count character occurrences.
2. **Increment and Decrement Counts**:
   - For `s = "anagram"`, increment counts.
   - For `t = "nagaram"`, decrement counts.
3. **Check for Zero Counts**: All counts are zero, indicating all characters match in frequency.

**Output**: true

This demonstration clearly shows the efficiency of using a hash table to quickly verify if two strings are anagrams by ensuring their character counts are identical.
