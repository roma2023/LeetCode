## Analysis of Approaches

### Brute-force Approach
**Description**: The brute-force method involves sorting the array first and then traversing it to count the longest sequence of consecutive numbers.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step, followed by `O(n)` to traverse the sorted array, which makes it less efficient.
- **Drawbacks**: This method is not optimal for large data sets as sorting can be quite costly in terms of time.

### Using Extra Storage
**Description**: Another approach could be to use a hash table to record each element's presence and then check for consecutive sequences by continuously checking the hash table.
- **Time Complexity**: While this approach could also be `O(n)`, it typically involves more overhead and complexity in implementation compared to using a set.

## Optimal Solution Explanation

The solution finds the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array using a set. Hereâ€™s the plan in detail:

1. **Initialize Set**: Convert the input list to a set to facilitate quick lookups of consecutive numbers.
2. **Find Sequences**:
    - Traverse each number in the input list.
    - If the current number does not have a preceding consecutive neighbor (i.e., `num - 1` is not in the set), then it marks the start of a new sequence.
    - Starting from this number, keep counting consecutive numbers until the next number isn't found in the set.
    - Track the maximum length of consecutive sequences found.
3. **Return Maximum Length**: Return the maximum length of any consecutive sequence.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` since each number is only processed once when checking for consecutive sequences.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` because the set stores all unique numbers from the input list.

## Demonstration of the Optimal Solution

Let's walk through the optimal solution using Example 1:

**Input**: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

### Step 1: Initialize Set
First, convert the array into a set to facilitate quick lookups.
- Set: `{100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}`

### Step 2: Identify Starting Points
Next, identify numbers that are potential starting points of consecutive sequences. These are numbers that do not have a preceding consecutive element in the set.
- Potential starts: `100`, `4`, `200`, `1` (since `0`, `3`, `199`, and `0` are not in the set)

### Step 3: Count Consecutive Numbers
Now, we count consecutive numbers starting from each potential starting point:

- Starting from `100`: Just `100` (Length = 1)
- Starting from `200`: Just `200` (Length = 1)
- Starting from `4`: Sequence is `4, 5` (Length = 1, because `5` is not in the set)
- Starting from `1`: Sequence is `1, 2, 3, 4` (Length = 4)

### Step 4: Track Maximum Length
The longest consecutive sequence found is from starting number `1`, yielding a sequence `1, 2, 3, 4` with a length of `4`.

**Output**: The length of the longest consecutive sequence is `4`.
