## Analysis of Approaches

### Naive Approach
**Description**: A straightforward method could involve calculating the product of all elements for each index, excluding the current index, by traversing the array.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)`, due to nested loopsâ€”one to iterate over the array and another to calculate the product for each index.
- **Drawbacks**: This approach is inefficient and not feasible for larger arrays due to its high time complexity.

### Division Approach (Not Allowed)
**Description**: Computing the total product of the array and then dividing by each element to get the result.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, but this approach does not meet the problem's constraint of avoiding division, especially considering zeros in the array.

## Optimal Solution Explanation

The solution calculates the product of all elements in an array except for the element itself without using division. This is achieved using prefix and postfix products. Here's the method in detail:

1. **Initialize Result Array**:
   - Start with a result array `res` initialized with 1s. This array will store the result of the product except self for each element.
2. **Calculate Prefix Product**:
   - Iterate through the array from the start, updating `pre` to hold the product of all previous numbers. Update the result array such that each element at index `i+1` holds the product of all numbers before it.
3. **Calculate Postfix Product**:
   - Iterate through the array from the end, updating `post` to hold the product of all following numbers. Simultaneously, update the result array to multiply the existing value by the product of all numbers after it.
4. **Combine Prefix and Postfix**:
   - By the end of these operations, each element in the result array represents the product of all other elements in the array except itself.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. Each element is visited a constant number of times (once for prefix calculations and once for postfix calculations).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the result array that is returned. The additional space used for the `pre` and `post` variables is constant, `O(1)`.

## Demonstration of the Optimal Solution

Let's walk through the optimal solution using Example 1:

**Input**: nums = [1,2,3,4]

### Step 1: Initialize Result Array
Initialize the result array `res` with values [1, 1, 1, 1] to hold the products.

### Step 2: Calculate Prefix Product
- After the first pass, the `res` array updates as follows, based on the product of all numbers before each index:
  - For index 1: `res[1] *= 1` (product of all elements before `nums[1]`)
  - For index 2: `res[2] *= 1 * 2` (product of all elements before `nums[2]`)
  - For index 3: `res[3] *= 1 * 2 * 3` (product of all elements before `nums[3]`)
- Resulting `res`: [1, 1, 2, 6]

### Step 3: Calculate Postfix Product
- After the second pass from the end of the array, update `res` based on the product of all numbers after each index:
  - For index 2: `res[2] *= 4` (product of all elements after `nums[2]`)
  - For index 1: `res[1] *= 4 * 3` (product of all elements after `nums[1]`)
  - For index 0: `res[0] *= 4 * 3 * 2` (product of all elements after `nums[0]`)
- Resulting `res`: [24, 12, 8, 6]

### Step 4: Combine Prefix and Postfix
The final `res` array now accurately represents the product of all elements except the element itself for each index.

**Output**: [24, 12, 8, 6]

This step-by-step demonstration shows how both prefix and postfix products contribute to each index's final value in the result array. Each element of `res` at index `i` is computed by multiplying two products: all numbers before `i` (prefix) and all numbers after `i` (postfix).
